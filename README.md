# AF_Microservices
Introduction:
Welcome to the Employment Agency backend application! This repository contains the code for the backend of an employment agency web application that allows job seekers to search for available jobs and employers to post job openings. The application is built using .NET 5 and follows a microservices architecture, with separate services for job postings, job applications, and user management. The services communicate with each other using MassTransit and RabbitMQ, and are secured using JWT authentication. The application also utilizes Ocelot API Gateway for routing and aggregation of microservices. This repository is intended for developers who want to contribute to the development of the Employment Agency application or who want to deploy a local instance of the application for testing or demonstration purposes.
