Our job portal application is a modern, microservices-based platform designed to connect job seekers with potential employers. Built using the latest technologies and frameworks, our application offers a wide range of features and capabilities to help users find and apply for their dream jobs.

Key Features:

User-friendly interface for job seekers and employers

Our application is designed to be highly scalable and modular, with a microservices architecture that enables seamless integration of new features and services. We have implemented Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) patterns to achieve loose coupling between services and maintain high system availability.

With our advanced search capabilities, real-time notifications, and machine learning-based recommendation engine, you can quickly and easily find the right job or candidate to meet your needs.
